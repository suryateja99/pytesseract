''' 
Part #1 : Converting PDF to images 
'''
  
# Store all the pages of the PDF in a variable 

# Counter to store images of each page of PDF to image 
    
# Iterate through all the pages stored above 
    
  
        # Declaring filename for each page of PDF as JPG 
    # For each page, filename will be: 
    # PDF page 1 -> page_1.jpg 
    # PDF page 2 -> page_2.jpg 
    # PDF page 3 -> page_3.jpg 
    # .... 
    # PDF page n -> page_n.jpg 
        
      
    # Save the image of the page in system 
        
    # Increment the counter to update filename 
       
  
''' 
Part #2 - Recognizing text from the images using OCR 
'''
    
# Variable to get count of total number of pages 
    
  
# Creating a text file to write the output 
    
  
# Open the file in append mode so that  
# All contents of all images are added to the same file 
    
  
# Iterate from 1 to total number of pages 
    
  
        # Set filename to recognize text from 
    # Again, these files will be: 
    # page_1.jpg 
    # page_2.jpg 
    # .... 
    # page_n.jpg 
       
    # Recognize the text as string in image using pytesserct 
     
  
    # The recognized text is stored in variable text 
    # Any string processing may be applied on text 
    # Here, basic formatting has been done: 
    # In many PDFs, at line ending, if a word can't 
    # be written fully, a 'hyphen' is added. 
    # The rest of the word is written in the next line 
    # Eg: This is a sample text this word here GeeksF- 
    # orGeeks is half on first line, remaining on next. 
    # To remove this, we replace every '-\n' to ''. 
         
  
    # Finally, write the processed text to the file. 
    
  
# Close the file after writing all the text.
